# Coding challenge

**With this challenge we want to give you the opportunity to show off your creative side. It's fine to work with static values or data from a text file, no need to go all engineery on this.** 

**We want to see what you can do with React and specifically CSS when you have free range. You should focus your efforts on the interface for this task, not on writing elegant React code .**

Create a [Pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) app. It should be able to do the following thing:

- Start and stop a 25 minute countdown timer

**Note 1:** We do not expect you to create a stunning visual design by yourself, this is a development role. All power to you if you can though!

**Note 2:** We do not expect this to be perfect. It's okay if your solution has bugs or only works on the happy path right after the app loaded for the first time.

**In the app's bright future it should be possible to extend it with the following things:**

- Let the user set a timer duration
- Alternate between 3 different durations according to the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique): a stretch of focused work followed by a short break, and a long break after every four work stretches
- Let the user name or tag their tasks for which they set a timer (e.g. "write blog post") and display them in a list, along with their duration

**You do not need to implement any of these features, just keep them in the back of your head so you don't code yourself into a corner.**
